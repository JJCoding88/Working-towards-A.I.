I am looking to take a program and be able to automatically sent a reply email with a special form for the sender to fill out and submit back, where the submit button
is going to send to a new email address, that email form will take that information from the form and create a pdf file with specific name pulled from the form...
The save place will be saved inside of a new directory created for that specific file. I want to have that directory be able to get any information that is sent about 
that name/number and create a new file with the name/number1, 2, 3, 4 and on and on. I want the folder to automatically combine the files at the end of a work day.
The combined files will be saved as the original name/number . pdf and can then be sent to another application that will index the document for online storage to get 
away from us needing paper files, or having to use scanners. ultimatley saving money and time!!! any help or advice on this project would be great, I still am learning 
coding on my own through codeacademy and just using some youtube here and there... so again any help is greatly appriciated however I also want to be able to learn 
from this, so advice given in a way to where I can type the code in and maybe just help with the functions would be great, if you are not able/willing to do that
then I will take a code that I just copy that is fine, I will learn from seeing how it works.

                              THANK YOU,
                                Jeff
